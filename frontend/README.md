# Frontend (minimal skeleton)

This is a minimal React frontend skeleton created to replace the previous `frontend` folder.

Quick start:

```powershell
cd student-progress-tracker-main/frontend
npm install
npm start
```

If you want the original frontend restored from Git, provide the repo root containing `.git` and I can restore instead.
